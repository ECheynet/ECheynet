## Current status

I am now an associate professor at the Geophysical Institute and the bergen Offshore wind centre (BOW) at the University of Bergen (UiB). 

## Interests

### Boundary layer meteorology: 

    - Characterization of the coherence of turbulence above the sea and in Norwegian fjords.
    - Influence of the topography on the mean and turbulent flow characteristics.
    - Synthetic turbulence generation in the atmospheric surface layer.
    - Influence of the blocking by the surface on the spectral characteristics of turbulence.

### Wind engineering: 

    - Turbulent wind load modelling on long-span bridges.
    - Data-driven modelling for structural dynamics.
    - Full-scale vibration analysis.

### Lidar remote sensing of wind: 
    - Can scanning Doppler wind lidars measure turbulence?.
    - Study of the flow around bridges with short-range and long-range wind lidar instruments.
